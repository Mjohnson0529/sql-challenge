# sql-challenge

Module 9 SQL challenge 

For this challenge I had to create an ERD in order to display the relationships between the tables.

For the data engineering portion of the assignment I had to create a schemata that created tables to import the data from the CSV files into.

Lastly, I had to query the data in order to find out various things about the company's departments and employees
